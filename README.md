RobotPy Example Code
====================

This repository contains lots of example code that can be used to learn more
about creating robots using RobotPy. These examples are for core
RobotPy/WPILib libraries. Examples specific to individual vendors can be
found in their individual RobotPy repository under their 'examples' folder:

* [Cross The Road Electronics (CTRE)](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-ctre/tree/main/examples)
* [NavX](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-navx/tree/main/examples)
* [REV Robotics](https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-rev/tree/main/examples)

For RobotPy documentation, go to https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/

Contributions
-------------

WPILib (and the various vendors) have lots of examples that haven't been
translated from C++/Java into Python yet. If there's an example that you
found helpful for understanding how to write robot code, we'd love for you
to take a shot at translating it into python and contributing to this
repository!

Please follow the following guidelines:

* Retain the original license information
* They must run! You *must* test your code on either a robot or in simulation
* Tests for this repository must continue to pass (formatting, unit tests, etc)
